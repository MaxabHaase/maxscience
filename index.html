        The molecular machines of life have been shaped by billions years of evolution. This can lead to unintuitive ways by which cells operate. My research aims to gain a better understanding of the natural world within, and around us using the historical context of evolution. In particular I am fascinated by the process of chromosome segregation and the processes that ensure its high fidelity across eons. My long term ambition to gain a high resolution understanding of how genomes functionally evolve. To do this I am using the diversity of an entire subphylum of species, the Saccharomycotina, which is home to the Brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces. The benefits of this systems are many: 1) They are closely related to humans and share thousands of genes and functions, 2) They are as diverse at the level of DNA as all animals and plants, 3) They have small, simplified genomes, and species-specific genetic manipulation are possible, and 4) Their small genomes have undergone many revolutionary changes, making their genomes a treasure trove of compelling evolutionary stories.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to achieve a phylum level resolution of functional genome elements like the centromeres to better understand how species and genomes evolve. These question manifest at many levels, but my current focus is on the precise atomic structure of the native centromere-kinetochore complex and the evolutionary derivation of point centromeres.

          <p>
            I am an American evolutionary biologist with interests in how cells divide, how chromosomes organize, and how genomes evolve. I received my PhD from New York University where I was advised by Jef Boeke.
            <p>
            I am now a MSCA Postdoctoral Fellow with Andrea Musacchio at the MPI in Dortmund investigating the atomic structure of native kinetochore molecules.
