          <p>
            I am from Green Bay, Wisconsin – a place best known for its industrial history and American football team, and not so much biomedical research. In fact the world of acedemic research was a total unknown to me until my second year of college.

            <p>
            The most formative moment was taking the general genetics course during my time at the University of Wisconsin, as thats when I met my future mentor Chris Hittinger, who taught me everything about yeast genomics and evolution and opened the possibility of research as a career option.

            <p>
            With a fresh degree in evolutionary biology I then decided to head to New York to pursue my PhD with Jef Boeke. Here I learned a lot about genetics and synthetic biology with a focus on the biology of chromatin and chromosome segregation.

            <p>
            I am now a MSCA Postdoctoral Fellow with Andrea Musacchio at the MPI in Dortmund (strangely, also best known for its industrial history and fußball team) investigating the atomic structure of native kinetochore molecules.
             </p>
            I plan to continue my research efforts blending these perspecitive, evolution, genetics, and biochemistry to answer fundamental questions as to how eukaryotes maintain their genomes and how they evolved.
